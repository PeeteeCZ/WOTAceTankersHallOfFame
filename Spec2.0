- data structure change and migration
  - { "snapshotDate" : "2015-03-01",
      "players" : [
		{
			"id" : 502595931,
			"name" : "Tomylw",
			"snapshots" : [
				{
					"date" : "2015-03-01",

					"ratingRank" : 1,
					"aceTankers" : 120,
					"rankInAceTankers" : 1000

  - called function either returns optional with value, without (to repeat) or throws exception (bail out)

- logging of exceptions or bad data to log

- check for new players against certain snapshot

- read nickname (account/info) with batches of 100 player IDs

- read rating+ratingRank (ratings/accounts) with batches of 100 player IDs

- read ace tankers (account/tanks) with batches of 100 player IDs WHEN SNAP DATE = yesterday, otherwise read 1 by 1 with (tanks/stats)
  - when all ace tankers are read, sort by them and assign ace tanker ranks
